index.html contains HTML source code with Fortfan examples in code blocks.
Use process.py to add semantic highlighting to the HTML, and to test compilation of the examples.
Some of the examples contain broken code on purpose, so expect to see compilation errors.
This would probably be better served by some sort of unit testing with expected failures etc.

Usage:
python process.py <index.html >index2.html
